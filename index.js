    TASK 4
    In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:

    1. Window binding which will return the window object if we dont give 'this' context

    2. Implicit binding which will imply that to the left of your dot is what 'this refers to

    3. Explicit binding will explicitly tell you what to bind 'this' too

    4. Constructor will refer 'this' to the specific instance of the object that is created and returned by contructor
